          <h3>Self Care</h3>
          <p>
            Self-care is more than just pampering — it’s about giving yourself
            time and space to recharge emotionally. Small, intentional routines
            can help reduce stress and improve mood. Here are three simple
            self-care practices anyone can try:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Deep Breathing:</strong> Take five minutes to breathe
              slowly and deeply. It helps calm the nervous system.
              <a href="mental.html">- Try out this breathing exercise</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital Detox:</strong> Step away from your phone or
              computer for a short break to reset your mind.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Take a Walk:</strong> A quick walk outside can clear your
              head and boost emotional clarity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Making time for self-care sends a powerful message: your wellbeing
            matters.

          <h3>Identifying and Acknowledging Emotions</h3>
          <p>
            Being aware of your emotions is the first step toward emotional
            balance. When you name your feelings—whether it's frustration,
            sadness, excitement, or anxiety—you give yourself the power to
            respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try checking in with yourself a few times a day: How am I feeling?
            Why might I be feeling this way? Over time, this habit can help you
            identify emotional triggers and develop healthier responses.

          <h3>Practicing Gratitude</h3>
          <p>
            Gratitude is a simple but powerful tool for boosting emotional
            wellness. It shifts your focus from what’s lacking to what’s
            meaningful. Practicing gratitude regularly can reduce stress,
            improve sleep, and enhance relationships.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Start a gratitude journal — write down three things you're
              thankful for each day.
            </li>
            <li>Say thank you more often, even for small gestures.</li>
            <li>
              Reflect on positive moments before bed to end your day on a good
              note.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Gratitude doesn't ignore the hard parts of life — it helps you see
            the good alongside the difficult.

          <h3>Emotional Release Exercises</h3>
          <p>
            Holding in emotions can build stress over time. Emotional release
            exercises provide a healthy outlet to let go of built-up tension.
            Activities like crying, journaling, or even yelling into a pillow
            are all valid ways to process strong feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Science shows that crying releases oxytocin and endorphins —
            hormones that relieve pain and boost mood. Screaming (in a safe,
            private space) can also help release pent-up anger or anxiety. The
            goal is expression, not suppression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Give yourself permission to feel and release. It’s not weakness —
            it’s a way to heal.
          </p>
