          <h3>Physical Exercises</h3>
          <p>
            Regular physical activity is one of the most effective ways to
            support overall wellness. It boosts energy, strengthens muscles, and
            improves heart health. Even small movements can make a big
            difference. Here are three simple and effective exercises:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Walking:</strong> Just 30 minutes a day can improve
              cardiovascular health and mood.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bodyweight Squats:</strong> Strengthen your legs and core
              without any equipment. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stretching:</strong> Helps maintain flexibility and
              prevent injury. Aim for 5–10 minutes of daily stretching.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Incorporating these activities into your routine doesn’t require a
            gym — just commitment and consistency.

          <h3>Nutrition</h3>
          <p>
            What you eat directly affects how your body functions. Proper
            nutrition fuels your body with the energy it needs to thrive. Diets
            rich in whole foods — such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and
            whole grains — support both physical and mental performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, processed foods high in sugar, saturated fat, and
            sodium offer little nutritional value. They can lead to fatigue,
            poor concentration, and long-term health risks. Eating well isn’t
            about perfection — it’s about making informed choices that support
            your energy and wellbeing.

          <h3>Sleep</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep is essential for physical recovery, brain function, and
            emotional regulation. Adults typically need 7–9 hours of sleep per
            night. Poor sleep can weaken your immune system, impair memory, and
            increase the risk of chronic conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A consistent bedtime routine, limiting screen time before bed, and
            avoiding caffeine late in the day can significantly improve your
            sleep quality. Think of sleep as your body’s natural reset button —
            don’t skip it!

          <h3>Substance Use</h3>
          <p>
            Substance use — including alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs —
            can have a significant negative impact on physical health. It may
            damage organs, disrupt brain chemistry, and lead to long-term
            dependence or illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even casual use can interfere with sleep, nutrition, and exercise
            goals. If you're struggling with substance use or want to support
            someone who is, seeking help from a healthcare provider or support
            group can make a big difference.
