          Because we all run into hardships, whether that be with finances,
          academics, relationships, or other personal challenges, it is
          important to find ways to destress and take moments to recharge.

          <h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
          <p>
            <!-- Source: https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/education/why-is-mental-health-important -->
            Taking care of mental health is equally as important as taking care
            of your body. It is a common understanding that eating certain
            foods, exercise, and sleep can impact the way we feel, but it is
            less common of an understanding to know that the way we think, feel,
            and behave also has a major impact on our work, relationships, and
            ability to make decisions.

            <!-- Source: https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/why-is-physical-activity-so-important-for-health-and-wellbeing -->
            As our lifestyles have dramatically changes over the centuries,
            humans no longer depend as much on activities like walking, running,
            or lifting heavy objects in order to survive. For this reason, it is
            important to work in light activity into each day, since our bodies
            still thrive on movement for our physical and mental well-being.

          <h3>Emotional Wellness</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional health refers to one's ability to adapt and recover from
            challenging life events, as well as understanding emotions and
            feelings caused by one's experiences. There are a number of ways to
            enhance emotional wellness, promoting resilence, mindfulness, and
            the ability to cope with stress.
